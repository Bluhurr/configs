# Bluhurr Certified Configs

My configs for various apps (neovim, tmux, fish, etc.)

## Basic Instructions:

- For `.config` files, make sure to save old configs somewhere else.
- Then copy over the `.config` folder contents from the repo into the local `.config` folder.
- For Oh-My-Fish (omf), you'll need to copy over the theme folder & files from the `omf-theme` repo folder into the local omf theme folder.
  - While in Fish shell, use the command `omf cd` to open the omf folder and you'll find the theme folder there.
  - Place the theme from the repo into the local omf `themes` folder.
